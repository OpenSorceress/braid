A very work-in-progress library of fabric stuff for deploying twisted
infrastrucutre. The immeidate goal is to be able to redeploy everything from
cube onto dornkirk.

This package is a library of tools for deploying individual services. It also
currently contains a fabfile for global configuration of dornkirk.

The idea is that each individual service (e.g., t-names, www-data, trac,
buildbot) will have a configuration repo with a fabfile that uses braid to
deploy itself on a given machine.
