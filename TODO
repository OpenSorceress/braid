Brain-dump:

- Figure out how to handle config, with split-repos

  Perhaps this is just `~/.fabricrc` or maybe we want a `~/.braidrc` instead.
  Or maybe we don't actually need a config file. We just point things at dornkirk,
  and override on the command file.

- Initialize /etc/ssh/sshd_config to use 'Match Group service' for authorized keys.

  Also figure out where we should put keys, and add some tools for updating them.

  The latter perhaps wants to use something like launchpadadduser.

- If we don't use virtualenv, we need to get pip installed for pypy. Also, it might
  make sense to use the latest release of pypy, rather than the packaged version.

  Also, how do ~/start scripts then invoke twistd? This is the part of the fancy
  initscript wrapper that seems the most useful. But I think it only needs to be
  a couple of lines. (Or maybe a few more, but clearer lines of
  twisted.python.usage.)

- Implemente other services.

- The setup of the base image should probably be a seperate command, rather than
  automatically being called by each service. This includes stuff like python, pypy
  gcc (for 'pip install twisted'), git, bzr.

  Do we want to verify that stuff is installed, before doing the service install then?

- Adding and maintaining crontab entries.
