boot EC2 instance w/ ami-a73264ce
on the instance
    - sudo apt-get update
      (https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/48)
    - make sure setuptools >= 0.8 is installed on CPython
      (https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/49)

ensure you have a key that allows ssh access to a user with sudo-to-root ability and to root itself on the host
(https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/50)

on your local machine:
    - initialize your braid virtualenv
    - $ fab -i ${key} -u ${someuser} -H ${ip} -k base.bootstrap

on the instance
    - make sure setuptools >= 0.8 is installed on PyPy
      (https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/49)

on your local machine:
    - $ fab -i ${key} -u ${someuser} -H ${ip} -k t-web.install

on the instance
    - checkout the `fixes` branch of t-web in ~t-web/config
    - edit the HOSTNAME in ~t-web/config/twisted-web/twisted-web and make it the public ip of the node

on your local machine:
    - $ fab -i ${key} -u ${someuser} -H ${ip} -k t-web.start
      (this might fail, depends how well you got pypy/setuptools working together,
       see https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/51,
       consider editing _real_twisted-web to work-around if you have a problem)

    - $ fab -i ${key} -u ${someuser} -H ${ip} -k trac.install
    - $ fab -i ${key} -u ${someuser} -H ${ip} -k trac.start

on the instance, as the trac user, in ~trac:
    - touch ~trac/config/htpasswd
      (https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/53)
    - get a trac database from somewhere
      (https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/54)
      eg `ssh trac@twistedmatrix.com pg_dump | psql´
    - get the svn repo from somewhere
      eg `rsync -azP trac@twistedmatrix.com:svn/ svn/´
